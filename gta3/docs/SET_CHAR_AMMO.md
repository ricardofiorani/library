This command sets the character's weapon ammo. If the character does not have the weapon, the weapon is given to it. Unlike GIVE_WEAPON_TO_CHAR, it sets rather than adds to the ammo count and does not set the weapon as the current one for the character. You have to use SET_CURRENT_CHAR_WEAPON to set it as the current one. When the character dies, it drops the weapon as a pickup type 4 (PickupType.OnceTimeout) with predefined ammo count. If the ammo count is already less than the predefined count, it drops that ammo count instead.
