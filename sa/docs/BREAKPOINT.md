This command creates a new debug breakpoint. DEBUG_ON must be used before this command for the breakpoint to be triggered.

If the first argument is not `false`, the entire game will be paused.

Extra arguments can be used to display a formatted message on screen when breakpoint is triggered. Execution can be continued by pressing the key assigned to this breakpoint (F5-F12, depending on the currently triggered breakpoint count)
