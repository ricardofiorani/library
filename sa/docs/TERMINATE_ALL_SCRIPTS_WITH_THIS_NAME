This command stops the execution of all script s with this name. Scripts can be named through SCRIPT_NAME and more than one scripts can have the same name. Any upper case letters (A-Z) are converted to lower case by the game internally.

Calling this command to terminate custom CLEO scripts may cause undefined behavior and possible crashes. Use TERMINATE_ALL_CUSTOM_SCRIPTS_WITH_THIS_NAME instead.
