This command gets the height in the z-axis of the ground below the specified coordinates point. There is a ground if there is a collision loaded beneath the point. If there is no solid ground below the point, the height would return `0.0`. For Vice City and San Andreas, if you want to guarantee that the collision at the point is loaded, use REQUEST_COLLISION followed by LOAD_ALL_MODELS_NOW to force the loading of the collision and then immediately retrieve the ground z.
