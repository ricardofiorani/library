This command creates a horseshoe pickup. Like most pickups, it spins and can be "picked up" by walking through it. Horseshoes are recorded in stat 241. The total amount of horseshoes depends on the amount of pickups you have placed. Picking up a horseshoe gives you $100. Picking up all the horseshoes will give you $10,000. The pickup uses the model `cj_horse_shoe.dff` to create the pickup so the model has to be at least defined somewhere in an IDE file for the command to work.
