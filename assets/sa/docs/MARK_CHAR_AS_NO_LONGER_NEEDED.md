This command marks the character as no longer needed by the script and turns it into a random ped. When a character is spawned (CREATE_CHAR, etc.) or grabbed from the world (GET_RANDOM_CHAR_IN_ZONE, etc.), the character will remain in the game without despawning until this command is called or the game is reloaded. If spawned during a mission, calling the mission cleanup routine automatically marks any characters spawned during the mission as no longer needed. When the character is marked no longer needed, the character will walk off like a regular pedestrian and will disappear off-screen. However, as long as the character remains on-screen, the script can continue to recognize the character until it disappears.
