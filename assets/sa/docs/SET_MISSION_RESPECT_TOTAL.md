This command modifies a value stored in stat `228` (StatId.RespectMissionTotal). This value affects how the player's respect is changed after awarding new mission respect points. See AWARD_PLAYER_MISSION_RESPECT for more information.

The original script sets the total number of mission respect points to `1339`. This is the exact sum of all points awarded after completing all missions. 

Failing to call this command or using a low value will cause the player's respect to skyrocket when new mission respect points are awarded.
