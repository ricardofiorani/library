CLEO5 introduced idea of stream types:
* None - no volume or speed corrections are applied (like in CLEO4)
* Sfx - automatically follows game's sfx volume and in-game speed changes
* Music - automatically follows game's music volume, muted if current in-game speed is different than 1.0
* UserInterface - automatically follows game's sfx volume, unaffected by in-game speed
