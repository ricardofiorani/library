This command spawns a vehicle of the specified model and gives remote control of it to the player. 

If the specified model is an RC Bandit, the command functions equivalently to GIVE_REMOTE_CONTROLLED_CAR_TO_PLAYER. Using this command requires the model to be already loaded, usually through REQUEST_MODEL, or else the game will crash. Any model other than the RC Bandit does not allow detonation on contact and, in GTA III, is not restricted by zones where the RC Bandit immediately detonates. Otherwise, the command behaves the same way as GIVE_REMOTE_CONTROLLED_CAR_TO_PLAYER.

The command is intended to be used while the player is in a vehicle. See GIVE_REMOTE_CONTROLLED_CAR_TO_PLAYER on possible effects of using this command while the player is on foot.
