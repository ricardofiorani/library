By default, any new script is named `noname`. This command renames the current script to the one specified. Any upper case letters (A-Z) are converted to lower case by the game internally. TERMINATE_ALL_SCRIPTS_WITH_THIS_NAME can be used to end scripts with this given name.

In GTA3script there cannot be two scripts with the same name in a given multifile, in such case the compiler will emit an error.
