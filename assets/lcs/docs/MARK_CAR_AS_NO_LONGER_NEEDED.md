This command marks the vehicle as no longer needed by the script and turns it into a traffic vehicle. When a vehicle is spawned (CREATE_CAR, etc.) or grabbed from the world (GET_RANDOM_CAR_OF_TYPE_IN_AREA, etc.), the vehicle will remain in the game without despawning until this command is called. If spawned during a mission, calling the mission cleanup routine automatically marks any vehicles spawned during the mission as no longer needed. When the vehicle is marked no longer needed, it will be treated like a traffic vehicle and will disappear off-screen. However, as long as the vehicle remains on-screen, the script can continue to recognize the vehicle until it disappears. Commands that grabs the handle of the vehicle (STORE_CAR_CHAR_IS_IN_NO_SAVE, etc.) do not treat vehicles as mission vehicles, so using this command with disregard will cause problems with other scripts (like during missions) trying to look for the vehicle.
