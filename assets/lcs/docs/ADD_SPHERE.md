This command creates a "sphere", which is a translucent cylinder that pulsates in size. The sphere serves only as a visual marker; it is not interactable. The center of the sphere will always place itself directly on the ground and cannot float in the air. The larger the scale value is, the larger the sphere. Negative values are actually valid; they just invert the sphere. A value of `1.0` will create a sphere with a diameter of `1.0`. In GTA III the color is blue, in Vice City it is pink, and in San Andreas it is red.

A maximum of `16` spheres can be physically created at a time but a smaller number of spheres can be visible at a time in the world. Spheres created by other commands like ADD_SPRITE_BLIP_FOR_CONTACT_POINT also limits the number of visible spheres in the world. When the visual limit is passed, spheres can still be physically created but they will not be visible. Removing the visibility of one sphere can cause the visibility of another sphere to be restored.

The sphere can be removed by calling REMOVE_SPHERE. When recreating a sphere after you removed it, you must wait until the sphere visually disappears before creating another one or else the new sphere would not update to its recreated properties.
