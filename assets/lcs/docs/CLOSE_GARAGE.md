This command sets the state of the garage to closed. The garage does not require a door but it is a good visual indication showing that the garage is closed. For some garages that have unique effects when closed like spray garages and bomb shops, using this command on these garages will force the effects to occur and bypass checks that are normally done to close the garage. So it is possible to invoke these effects, which include showing garage messages and taking away your money, while on foot outside the garage.
