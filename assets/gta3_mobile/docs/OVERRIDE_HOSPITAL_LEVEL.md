This command overrides the hospital level. The next time the player dies, the player will spawn at the hospital restart point on the corresponding level number. If there is no point on the corresponding level number, the default spawn behavior is used instead. The behavior resets after the player dies, is arrested, or if the level number is set to `0`. The value set with this command is saved in block 9 of the save file.
