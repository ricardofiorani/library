This command creates a type `8` mine pickup. It uses a model that matches the name `barrel1` , which produces a unique type `7` corona ring around the barrel. This command is almost equivalent to CREATE_PICKUP but the model is preset and a pickup handle is not stored. The mine pickup type in general behaves as follows. The pickup cannot be interacted while on foot. If the pickup is created while the player character is on foot, it creates an inactive mine. Having vehicles drive over the inactive mine produces no effect. Once the player is in any vehicle, the mine arms itself and set to detonate in `10` seconds. Any vehicle driving over the armed mine also detonates the mine. The resulting explosion is a type `6` mine explosion.
