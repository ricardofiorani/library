This command sets the proofs of the vehicle. Bullet-proof will prevent the vehicle from being damaged by bullets. Fire-proof will prevent the vehicle from being damaged by fire. Explosion-proof will prevent the vehicle from being damaged by explosions. Collision-proof will prevent the vehicle from being damaged by collisions. The fifth proof is suppose to be melee-proof but the property has no effect; melee damage is considered collision damage.
