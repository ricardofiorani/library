This command adds a square blip in the radar denoting the location of the pickup. It is almost equivalent to ADD_BLIP_FOR_PICKUP but without preset properties. The default scale of the blip is `1`. Both the blip and marker is removed if the pickup is removed by any means. For pickup types that allow the pickup to respawn, the blip and marker will not reappear when it respawns. This command was never called in the original script of GTA III.
