This command marks the object as no longer needed. When an object is spawned (CREATE_OBJECT, etc.), the object will remain in the game without despawning until this command is called. If spawned during a mission, calling the mission cleanup routine automatically marks any objects spawned during the mission as no longer needed. When the object is marked no longer needed, it will disappear off-screen. However, as long as the object remains on-screen, the script can continue to recognize the object until the object disappears.
