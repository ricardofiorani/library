This command creates a cutscene object. A cutscene object can be a special character using model `SPECIAL##` where ''##'' is a number from `01` to `04` in GTA III, `01` to `21` in Vice City, and `01` to `10` in San Andreas. It is loaded through LOAD_SPECIAL_CHARACTER. A cutscene object can also be defined in the `HIER` section of the IDE file. It is loaded through LOAD_SPECIAL_MODEL.
