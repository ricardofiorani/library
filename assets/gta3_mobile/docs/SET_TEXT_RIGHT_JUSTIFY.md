This command sets the text to be right-aligned. Rather than using the position of the text to align the left side of the text, the command allows using its position to align the right side of the text. The left edge of the screen determines the wrapping of the left side of the text. Text that is right-aligned is not affected by the wrap x (SET_TEXT_WRAPX) or centering (SET_TEXT_CENTRE_SIZE) of the text.
