This command creates a pickup of type PICKUP_COLLECTABLE1 (type `6`) at the coordinates point. It uses a model that matches the name `package1` , which produces a unique type `5` corona hexagon around the package. This command is almost equivalent to CREATE_PICKUP but the model is preset and a pickup handle is not generated.

The hidden package pickup type in general behaves as follows. Like most pickups, the package can be "picked up" by walking through it. Each time a package is collected, GXT key `CO_ONE` (Hidden Package ''X'' of ''Y'') appears, where ''X'' is the number of packages collected so far and ''Y'' is the set total number of packages , and affects the statistics as described SET_COLLECTABLE1_TOTAL. The player is rewarded $100, and SFX 364. When the number of packages collected so far matches the set total number of packages, GXT key `CO_ALL` is displayed and the player is rewarded $100,000. If the total number of packages is not set, the games default the total to 3. Additional packages can still be collected and recorded into the stats. Packages can only be picked up once.
