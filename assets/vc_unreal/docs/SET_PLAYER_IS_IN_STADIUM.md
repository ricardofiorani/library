This opcode greys the "radar" mini-map on the bottom left corner of the HUD. It is usually used to cover up the mini-map without disabling it. In Vice City, it has an additional effect that indicates the player is in the Hyman Memorial Stadium by positioning the player position arrow in the pause menu map over the stadium (exactly at `x: -1302.53, y: 1332.85`) with all blips disabled; the mini-map is not affected by the additional changes. The color of grey is `204,204,204` in RGB or `#CCCCCC` in hexadecimal.
