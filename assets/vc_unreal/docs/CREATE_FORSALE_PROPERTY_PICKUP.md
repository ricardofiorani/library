This command creates a type `18` (PickupType.PropertyForSale) forsale property pickup. It uses a model that matches the name `property_fsale`. Walking over the pickup displays a help message using the set GXT key. You can interact with it by pressing button `4` (ACTION key) while on foot. If you have enough money and the mission flag is not set, money is subtracted from you and the pickup is picked up. If you do not have enough money, a help message with GXT key `PROP_1` ("You don't have enough cash for this property") is displayed. If the mission flag is set, a help message with GXT key `PROP_2` ("You cannot buy property whilst on a mission") is displayed.
