This command creates a pickup of type PICKUP_MONEY (type `7` in GTA III, type `8` in Vice City and San Andreas) at the coordinates point. It uses a model that matches the name `money`. When it is picked up, the player is given the set amount of money. This command is almost equivalent to CREATE_PICKUP_WITH_AMMO but with preset parameters. The money pickup type in general can only be picked up once and disappears in 30 seconds after its creation if it is not picked up.
