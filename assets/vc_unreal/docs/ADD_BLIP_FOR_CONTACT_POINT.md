This command adds a square blip in the radar to the contact point and a pink marker (arrow) at the point. The blip and marker disappear during missions and reappear when the mission ends. The default properties of the blip, which can be changed using other commands, are:

- Color: 5 (purple)
- Scale: 3
- Display: 3 (both blip and marker)
