This command checks if the vehicle previously stored to the stuck cars array (ADD_STUCK_CAR_CHECK) is stuck. It is true if the vehicle does not travel the required distance for a certain period of time. No matter who controls the vehicle - the AI or the player, or is there a driver at all. If the vehicle marked as stuck then travels enough distance to meet the requirements set with ADD_STUCK_CAR_CHECK, the vehicle is no longer marked as stuck, and the command returns false.
