This command loads a splash screen from the specified texture file in the `txd` directory. Any upper case letters (A-Z) are converted to lower case by the game internally. In order to view the splash screen, you must set the fade color to `2 2 2`, and perform a fade (either in or out). The splash screen will fade in and out along with the screen. The texture name within the TXD file must match the TXD file name; if there is no match, the game displays a white screen.
