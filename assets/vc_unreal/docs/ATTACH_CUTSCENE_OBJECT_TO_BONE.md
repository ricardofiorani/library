This command attaches a cutscene object to the bone of another cutscene object. Cutscene objects are created using CREATE_CUTSCENE_OBJECT. If the bone does not exist, the object will not appear at all. The primary advantage of using this command over using SET_CUTSCENE_ANIM is that the object does not need to have its own animation. Any cutscene objects work including character models, but character models are not recommended because they will show up as a clump of meat. The original script called this command three times using the left or right hand as the bone to attach.
