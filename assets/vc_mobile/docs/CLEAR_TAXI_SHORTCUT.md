This command clears any taxi shortcut that is set up by SET_UP_TAXI_SHORTCUT or SET_SHORTCUT_DROPOFF_POINT_FOR_MISSION. It only has an effect after the Kaufman Cab is spawned. The marker is removed from the taxi and the player can no longer enter it as a passenger but can carjack it instead. The taxi will remain idle at the point. Using this command while the riding sequence is happening will disrupt the sequence.
