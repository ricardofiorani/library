This command gets the bus fares collected by the player so far. Bus fares can only be collected when you are stopped in a Coach at a bus stop. Each fare costs `$5` so the value it can return will be in multiples of `5`. Once this command is called, the bus fares collected will reset to `0` afterwards so you must store the value to another variable if you want to keep track of the total bus fares collected. You do not need to be in a Coach to use this command. The original script called this command only in the `BUS` script.
