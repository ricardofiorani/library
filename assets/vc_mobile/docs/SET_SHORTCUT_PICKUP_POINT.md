This command sets the taxi shortcut pick-up point for mission. The drop-off point and most of the behavior of the taxi shortcut is set using SET_SHORTCUT_DROPOFF_POINT_FOR_MISSION. The taxi requires a ground to spawn on, otherwise it would not spawn at all. A maximum number of `16` points can be set before the game disallows anymore points to be set. The original script uses eight, one in front of each hospital and police station. The point set with this command is saved in block `3` of the save file .
