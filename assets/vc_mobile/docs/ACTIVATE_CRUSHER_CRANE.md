This command grabs and activates a crane that accepts vehicles for the crusher. The crane behaves similarly to ones activated by ACTIVATE_CRANE with the following differences. The height of the pick up zone is set at -0.95099998 units. If the crane has a magnet, the magnet is moved appropriately for that height. When you deliver a vehicle model it does not accept, a message with GXT key `CR_1` ("Crane cannot lift this vehicle.") is displayed and the crane refuses the vehicle. The following vehicle models based on their IDE values are rejected by cranes activated with this command:

- 97 (Firetruck)
- 98 (Trashmaster)
- 102 (Blista)
- 118 (Securicar)
- 121 (Bus)
- 122 (Rhino)
- 126 (Dodo)

The crusher itself is separate from the crane and is not tied to this restriction or the crane. It is technically considered a garage and its creation is hardcoded.
