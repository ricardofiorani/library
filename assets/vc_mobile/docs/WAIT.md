This command stops an execution of the script for specified amount of time in milliseconds. A value of `0` means that the script will regain focus as soon as possible, whereas values greater than `0` denote the minimum time span that has to go by before the script is revisited. A wait is required for any loops that do not terminate as soon as reasonably possible. Without a wait, the game locks itself into processing the script and cannot process the rest of the game. It is bad practice to use a very long wait in scripts that loop; for that, it is much better to use game timers like GET_GAME_TIMER or local variable timers.
