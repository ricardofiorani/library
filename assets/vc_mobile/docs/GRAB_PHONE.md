This command gets a payphone object matching the model name `phonebooth1` , which can be placed into the world through the IPL file, closest to the coordinates point and assigns it a handle. Up to `49` phones can be stored in the game. If the payphone is already grabbed, it grabs the next closest payphone. This command itself does not create a payphone object. The coordinates point does not need to be accurate but its distance from the payphone must be within `100` units or else the game can crash.
