This command forces the game to only spawn on foot pedestrians of the specified ped type. The only ped types that work with this command are any valid gangs, emergency, and fireman. All other values either have no effect or crash the game. When used with gangs, you must load the models of the appropriate gang or else the map will be devoid of on foot pedestrians. Emergency and fireman models do not need to be explicitly loaded. This command has no effect on drivers in cars. A value of `-1` reverts the effects of this command. The original scripts called this command during rampages.
