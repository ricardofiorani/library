In Vice City, this command does not instantly kill depending on the health of the player or if the player can be damaged. Using this command subtracts `330` from the health of the player, so the player cannot be killed if one's health is over `330`. The player can also be not killed if the player is prevented from being hurt, e.g. while entering a vehicle, SET_PLAYER_CONTROL, or SET_CHAR_PROOFS with bulletproof set to true. If the player is in a car and is below the threshold of `330`, the car will instantly stop and the player will fall out of the vehicle as if shot in the head and die. If the player is in a bike and is below threshold, the player will be knocked off the bike and die.
