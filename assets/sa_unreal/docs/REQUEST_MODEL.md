This command requests the model to be loaded into the game. It is almost always required when using commands that spawns characters, vehicles, objects, or weapons. This is also used to speed up loading certain map objects that you want to load quickly. HAS_MODEL_LOADED checks if the model has been loaded, LOAD_ALL_MODELS_NOW loads all models without the need for HAS_MODEL_LOADED, and MARK_MODEL_AS_NO_LONGER_NEEDED marks the model as no longer needed.
