This command immediately loads all models requested using commands REQUEST_MODEL, UNDRESS_CHAR, or others. The game temporarily freezes until all requested models have been loaded. When using this command, it is unnecessary to use HAS_MODEL_LOADED to check if the models have been loaded. Commands that make use of the models like CREATE_CHAR and CREATE_CAR can do so immediately after this command without any chance of the game crashing due to unloaded models. Whether to use this command or HAS_MODEL_LOADED is mainly a design choice &mdash; do you want to freeze the game until all models are loaded or allow the game to run while it loads the models at its own pace?
