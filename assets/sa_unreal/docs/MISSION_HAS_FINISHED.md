This command resets ("cleans up") multiple settings that are usually set during missions and in some scripts. This helps in getting the game back to "normal" without the need to keep track of multiple settings. This command can only have an effect if it is called within a script launched as a mission using LOAD_AND_LAUNCH_MISSION_INTERNAL or, in GTA III and Vice City only, LAUNCH_MISSION; it has no effect elsewhere. The script does not need to follow the mission structure for this command to work.
