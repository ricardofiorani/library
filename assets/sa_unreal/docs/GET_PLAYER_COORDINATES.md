This command gets the x, y, and z-coordinates of the center of mass of the player's body. It is roughly +1.04 z higher than the z-coordinate of the player's feet, which is used when setting the player's coordinates using SET_PLAYER_COORDINATES. If the player is in a vehicle, the command gets the coordinates of the center of mass of the vehicle's body instead.
