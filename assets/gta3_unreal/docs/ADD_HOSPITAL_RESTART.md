This command creates a hospital restart point. When you get wasted, you will respawn at the closest hospital restart point. A maximum of `8` hospital restart points can be created. The game does not place a cap on the limit so adding too many points can crash the game. OVERRIDE_NEXT_RESTART can be used to override all points for only one restart. The points are saved in block 9 of the save file in GTA III, block 10 in Vice City, and block 8 in San Andreas.
