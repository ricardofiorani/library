This command allows the screen to fade in and fade back out. The color of the fade can be set through SET_FADING_COLOUR. The longer the time set to fade, the slower the screen will fade. As the screen fades in, game sounds will fade out, and vice versa. Use SET_MUSIC_DOES_FADE to prevent game sounds from being affected. The game is unable to be paused as the screen fades.
