This command changes the color of the blip. The color is determined by a predefined list and whether the blip is dim (DIM_BLIP). See `BlipColor` enum for possible values.

It is possible to use any color in the RGB color space as the color of the blip. The color parameter accepts any value in RGBA, allowing values between `7` and `0xFFFFFFFF`. The opacity is ignored by the game and the blip's dim property does not affect the color.

The command has no effect on sprites.
