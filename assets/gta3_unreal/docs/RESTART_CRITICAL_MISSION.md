This command is used to replay critical missions that can not be skipped. After calling the screen fades into a splash screen, and the player is put at the coordinates and rotated to the angle. Other effects are similar to that as if the player dies or being busted (he is moved out of a vehicle if there is any, his health is restored, the armour is reset to zero, fists are selected as the current weapon, however he does not lose the rest of his weapon). It does not automatically replay a mission, there has to be another script checking the player position and starting the mission. in GTA III this command is only used in the missions 'Give Me Liberty' and 'Luigi Girls'.
