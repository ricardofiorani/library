This opcode adds a square blip in the radar denoting the location of the pickup and a blue marker (arrow) above the pickup. The default properties of the blip, which can be changed using other opcodes, are:

    Color: 6 (cyan)
    Scale: 3
    Display: 3 (both blip and marker)

Both the blip and marker can be removed using REMOVE_BLIP.
