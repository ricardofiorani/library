This conditional command returns true if the player is controllable. The player is controllable if the animation sequences of the player character can be controlled through input keys. Animation sequences that do not allow direct control of the player character (e.g. falling through the air, entering a vehicle, ejecting from a vehicle, death) are considered not controllable and the command would return false. Commands that freeze control of the character (e.g. SET_PLAYER_CONTROL) do not apply. If controls are frozen but the animation would otherwise permit direct control of the character, the command will still return true.
