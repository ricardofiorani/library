This command loads a special model as a cutscene object. Similar to LOAD_SPECIAL_CHARACTER, the DFF model does not need to be defined in an IDE file. All the command needs is a valid model with a TXD of the same name. Any upper case letters (A-Z) are converted to lower case by the game internally. The clump model is treated like any models so HAS_MODEL_LOADED can be used to check if it has been loaded, MARK_MODEL_AS_NO_LONGER_NEEDED can be used to mark it as no longer needed, and LOAD_ALL_MODELS_NOW can be used to load it immediately.
