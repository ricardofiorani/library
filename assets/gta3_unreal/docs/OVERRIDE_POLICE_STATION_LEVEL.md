This command overrides the police station level. The next time the player gets arrested, the player will spawn at the police restart point on the corresponding level number. If there is no point on the corresponding level number, the default spawn behavior is used instead. The behavior resets after the player is arrested, dies, or if the level number is set to `0`. The value set with this command is saved in block 9 of the save file .
