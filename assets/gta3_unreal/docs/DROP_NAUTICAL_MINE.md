This command creates a type `10` nautical mine pickup (`PickupType.NauticalMineInactive`). It uses a model that matches the name `barrel2`, which produces a unique type 7 corona ring around the barrel (`CoronaType.Ring`). This command is almost equivalent to CREATE_PICKUP but the model is preset and a pickup handle is not stored. The nautical mine pickup type in general behaves as follows. The pickup cannot be interacted while on foot. Once created, the mine is set to detonate in `10` seconds. Any vehicle driving over the mine also detonates it. The resulting explosion is a type `6` mine explosion (`ExplosionType.Mine`). If the mine is created over land, the command obeys the z-coordinate parameter, but if the mine is created over water, the command ignores the z-coordinate parameter and always creates the mine on water surface. The pickup is unlike most pickups in that it can bob up and down with the waves of the water.
