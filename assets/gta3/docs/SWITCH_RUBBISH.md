This command switches the visibility of rubbish, which includes newspapers and leaves that fly around the environment on the ground. When rubbish is switched off, rubbish will slowly fade out of view, and when switched on will fade into view. The rubbish uses textures from the `particle.txd` file: `gameleaf01_64`, `gameleaf02_64`, `newspaper01_64`, `newspaper02_64`. Rubbish is switched on by default.
