This command creates a restart point that overrides all restart points, which include ones created through ADD_HOSPITAL_RESTART and ADD_POLICE_RESTART, only for the next player death or arrest. After the player is wasted or busted, the player will be spawned at the restart point and the override will be disabled, allowing all other restart points to resume. CANCEL_OVERRIDE_RESTART can be used to cancel the override. The override restart point and its status are saved in block 9 of the save file in GTA III, block 10 in Vice City, and block 8 in San Andreas.
