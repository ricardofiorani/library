This command "converts" integer values from meters to feet. By "convert", this means multiplying the value by `3.3333333`. The more precise conversion would be to [multiply by 3.2808399](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=convert+1+meter+to+feet%2C+8+digits). The output value does not round accordingly to traditional methods, e.g., inputting `2` will output `6` but inputting `3` will output `10`.
