This command grabs and deactivates a crane within 100.0 units of the specified location. The crane will stop whatever it is doing and rotate to its default position. If it is lifting a car, the car will be stuck mid-air. All cranes are affected by this &ndash; idle ones, crusher cranes, and military cranes. Non-idle cranes do not completely deactivate; they are still mostly functional and can still lift cars.
