This command creates a collection of donkey magazine pickup s. The pickups are created using a model that matches the name `donkeymag` and can only be picked up while the player is in a vehicle. There are a total of `106` pickups and their locations are hardcoded into the game. Calling this command again without first clearing them can crash the game. Values other than `0` produce no effect. The original script called this command during "Big'N'Veiny".
