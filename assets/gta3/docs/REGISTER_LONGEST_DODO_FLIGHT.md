This command saves the highest value to the "Longest flight in Dodo" stat (GXT key `FEST_LF`). The stat initially starts with a value of `0` and does not appear in the stats menu until its value is greater than `0`. Any value higher than the saved value will update the saved value with the new value; lower values have no effect on the stat. The value set with this command is saved in block 17 of the save file.
