This command creates a perpetual fire at the coordinates point. The fire emits particles, light, and sound, and can harm only the player. If ground z is used, the fire is placed by the center rather than the base of the particle so the fire appears a bit submerged into the ground. The fire can be extinguished with the Firetruck's hose or a Fire Extinguisher, or removed using REMOVE_SCRIPT_FIRE or REMOVE_ALL_SCRIPT_FIRES. If you start a new game without extinguishing the fire, the fire carries over into the new game.
