This command creates a car generator at the coordinates point. The car generator allows the creation of a perpetually spawning vehicle, behaving like a parked vehicle. It requires SWITCH_CAR_GENERATOR to switch on the generator. Unlike CREATE_CAR or others similar to it, you do not need to request the model of the vehicle. In San Andreas, the CARS section of the IPL works similar to this command. The car will be spawned as not owned by the player so if you enter the car in front of the police, you will be wanted. In San Andreas, parked vehicles will not be created while you are inside an interior.

The game adds `0.015` units to your z-coordinate value if you want to be really precise. Force spawn is forcing the vehicle to spawn more readily, sometimes even spawning it right in front of you. Without force spawn, the vehicle may not spawn when approaching the location of the vehicle too quickly. The alarm and door lock of the vehicle is based on a percent chance of occurring. A value of `0` means `0%` chance of triggering an alarm or `0%` chance of the door being locked. A value of `100` means `100%` chance of triggering an alarm or `100%` chance of the door being locked. The minimum and maximum delay values do not seem to be used by the game.

The limit for the amount of defined car generators in GTA III: `160`; Vice City: `185`; San Andreas: `500`. The data is saved in block `13` of the save file in GTA III, block `14` in Vice City, and block `12` in San Andreas.
