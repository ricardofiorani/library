This command adds a moving particle effects at the specified location for a duration of time. Particle effects must be in range of the player (about `95` units) when adding them into the world; they will not appear when added outside the range. Particle effects that have been added will disappear when the player moves out of range regardless of duration.

Using a particle effect outside the range listed below produces unpredictable results and may crash the game. The colors red, green, and blue only affect particle `14` in GTA III and particle `16` in Vice City and has no effect on anything else. Some particles do not obey the duration and are noted below. If the duration is set to `0`, particles that obey duration will loop forever; using REMOVE_PARTICLE_EFFECTS_IN_AREA or moving outside the range of the particle can remove a particle effect stuck in a loop. The strength represents the direction and length of movement of the particle. Some particles look meaningless or weird absence of the strength. Ones that are affected by gravity can be seen arcing towards the ground if an x- or y-strength is set. Some particles do not obey the strength and are noted below. Particle effects created with this command is saved in block `14` of the save file in GTA III and block `15` in Vice City.

The original script in GTA III uses particles `10`, `11`, `12`, `13`, `15`, `18`, and `19`; and in Vice City uses `4` and `17`.
