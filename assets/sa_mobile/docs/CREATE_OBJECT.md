This command creates an object at the coordinates point. The z-coordinate uses the base rather than the center of the object's bounding box. Use CREATE_OBJECT_NO_OFFSET to create an object without this offset. It is not required to load the model (like through REQUEST_MODEL) to create the object. The object must already have an entry in the `object.dat` file in order for them to be stable. Without an entry, the object can become unstable and when that happens the game will crash.
