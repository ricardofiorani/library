CLEO5 introduced idea of stream types:
None - no volume or speed corrections are applied (like in CLEO4)
Sfx - automatically follows game's sfx volume and in-game speed changes
Music - automatically follows game's music volume, unaffected by in-game speed
UserInterface - automatically follows game's sfx volume, unaffected by in-game speed
