This command saves the highest value to the "Highest Vigilante Mission level" stat (GXT key `FEST_HV`). The stat will initially start with a value of `0`. Any value higher than the saved value will update the saved value with the new value; lower values have no effect on the stat. The value set with this command is saved in block 19 of the save file .
