This command adds the vehicle to the upside down car check, a special memory pool to check if the vehicle is flipped. A maximum number of `6` vehicles can be added to this pool. Every millisecond the game checks the current state of the vehicles in the pool. If a vehicle is flipped over, i.e. its translation and rotational movements are minimal while upside down, the game counts the time passed from this moment. IS_CAR_STUCK_ON_ROOF reads this passed time to check if the vehicle is stuck on its roof.
