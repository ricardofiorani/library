This command flashes the HUD (heads-up display) item. Only one HUD item can flash at a time; flashing one item disables the flashing of all others. Only three values have an effect in GTA III and Vice City and four in San Andreas. Any other values are treated similarly to value `-1`, which disables all flashing.
