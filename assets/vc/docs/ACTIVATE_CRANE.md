This command grabs and activates a crane within 100.0 units of the specified location. The crane can lift any car within the pick up zone and move it to the drop off point. The crane's arm will rotate towards the center point of the pick up zone. The height of the pick up zone is set at the ground z of the center of the pick up zone. If the crane has a magnet, the magnet is moved appropriately for that height. The car must be stationary for the crane's hook to attach to the car. When the car gets attached to the crane's hook whether it is a magnet or not, it becomes non-solid. At the drop off point, the car is released and becomes solid again. If you stand underneath the drop off point, the crane will not drop off the car until you move away. If the car becomes destroyed while in transit (but not before), the crane will still continue moving it. The crane moves back to its initial state afterwards and can be reused again.
