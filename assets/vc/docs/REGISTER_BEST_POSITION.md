This command saves the lowest value to the "Hotring Best Result" stat (GXT key `STHC_05`). Interestingly, the stat initially starts with a value of `2147483647` (`0x7FFFFFFF`) and does not appear in the stats menu until its value is not equal to it. Any value lower than the saved value will update the saved value with the new value; higher values have no effect on the stat. The first argument is always `0`. The value set with this command is saved in block 19 of the save file.
