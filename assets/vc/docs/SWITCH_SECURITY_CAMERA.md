This command switches the security camera, which displays a green scan line overlay on the screen. The command is used for security cameras in Diaz's Mansion and El Banco Corrupto Grande. The scan line will overlay almost everything on the screen but notable exceptions include the clock and some texts like messages and big messages . The bottom right area of the screen will display a number that increases from `0` to `63` for 64 frames and loops back to `0`. The scan line will display a darker shade bar that scrolls down the screen and loops back after 62 frames.
