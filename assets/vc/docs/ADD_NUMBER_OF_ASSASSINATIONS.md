This command adds to the "Assassination Contracts Completed" stat ( GXT key `ST_ASSI`). The stat will initially start with a value of 0. The parameter can be any integer value, including negative ones. The value set with this command is saved in block 19 of the save file . The "out of 5" value is hardcoded within the game.
