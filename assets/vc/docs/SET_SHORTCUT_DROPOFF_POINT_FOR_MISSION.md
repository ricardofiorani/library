This command sets the taxi shortcut drop-off point for mission. Pick-up points are set using SET_SHORTCUT_PICKUP_POINT. After the drop-off point is set, when the player dies or gets arrested, a marked Kaufman Cab is spawned at the closest pick-up point. When pressing button `15` near it, controls are disabled and the player character enters it as a passenger. The taxi will drive straight while the screen fades out to black and a big message with GXT key `TAXI` ("Taxi") is displayed. The taxi then warps to the drop-off point, the screen fades back in, $9 is removed, the player character exits the taxi, and controls are resumed. The taxi is marked as no longer needed and becomes a normal traffic taxi. The destination requires a ground to spawn on, otherwise it spawns in unexpected positions. Only the most recent drop-off point is used.

This command is generally called at the beginning of missions although it is not required to do so. If the player dies or gets arrested during a mission, the taxi can be used as a shortcut to get back to the contact point. The taxi shortcut is disabled if REGISTER_MISSION_PASSED or REGISTER_ODDJOB_MISSION_PASSED is called, usually when the player passes a mission, or when a rampage is started. An active taxi shortcut can be cleared without riding it by calling CLEAR_TAXI_SHORTCUT or by setting up another taxi shortcut.
