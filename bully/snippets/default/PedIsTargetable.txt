// In the game this was used to check if Jimmy was targgeting a specific ped on a mission
// Usage:
let playerHandle = Player.GetChar();
let playerTargettingPed = playerHandle.IsTargettingPed(yourPed);

// Alternatively, you can also do:
let playerTargettingPed = Number(playerHandle.getTargetPed()) === Number(yourPed);
