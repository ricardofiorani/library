// There are different ways to check if a ped died:
// You can use this to check if a ped is fully lying on the ground dead:
let pedIsDead = yourPed.isDead();

// If you want to check if the ped is playing the knocked out animation, you can use this:
let pedIsDead = false;

if (yourPed.isValid()) {
	pedIsDead = yourPed.isPlaying("/Global/HitTree/KnockOuts", true);
}

// Or you can check if the ped is at 0 health, which is exactly when the ped will get knocked out by doing the following:
let pedIsDead = yourPed.getHealth() <= 0;
