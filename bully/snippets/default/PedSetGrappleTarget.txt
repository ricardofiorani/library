// Since setting both the target and grappler to -1 doesn't work as intended (and can even crash the game)
// You can use this to achieve a more desired result:
let playerHandle = Player.GetChar();
let grappleTarget = playerHandle.getGrappleTargetPed();
playerHandle.setGrappleTarget(-1);
grappleTarget.setActionNode("/Global/Ambient/Scripted/Empty/EmptyNode/TrueEmptyNode", "Act/Anim/Ambient.act");
