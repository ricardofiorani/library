// If you want to quickly check the attitude your target
// has towards the player faction and print it at the
// top center of the screen, you can use the following code:
import {PedType, TextPosition} from '../.config/enums';

let playerHandle = Player.GetChar();
let targetPed = playerHandle.getTargetPed();
let attitude = targetPed.getAttitudeTowardsFaction(PedType.Player1);

Text.PrintString(attitude, 1, TextPosition.MiddleTop);
