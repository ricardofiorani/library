This command creates a helicopter dust particle effect around an object, behaving almost exactly as the one created by helicopters. The command must be placed within a loop, preferably with a wait of `0`, in order to constantly create the particle effect. The radius parameter is the distance between the center of the object and the particles surrounding it at ground level. The density is capped at `8`; any value higher than `8` is treated as `8`. The player character must be within about 500 units of the object in order for the particle effect to be created. Pilotable helicopters in the game have a radius of `10.0` and density of about `9`. The original script used this command on Lance's cutscene helicopter in the introduction scene.
